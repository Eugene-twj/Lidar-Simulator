## About the project
This is a bachelors thesis witten during spring 2017 at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. The project aims to create a software model of a lidar sensor and a virtual enviroment to be able to model scenarios in which a lidar sensor may be used in the field of autonomous vehicles. The project is defined as follows: 

>The objective of this project is to provide a simulator of the Lidar sensor which is able to provide 3D scanning of a virtual environment. The project will be carried out using the Unity or the Unreal game engine. The students will be provided with all the software tools needed to implement, test and validate the simulated Lidar sensor, and to build the virtual environment which will be then measured by the virtual sensor. So, there will be mainly three submodules: 

This project is implemented using the Unity game engine, with the different scripts written in C#. The various graphical entities that exist in the scenes are taken from the unity asset store. 

## How to Compile
Use unity build tool.

## How to Install and Run
TBA

### Dependencies
Unity Engine 5.3
